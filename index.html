    <h2>Visualization On Top Run Scorer Dataset</h2>
    <h2>Introduction About The Data Set</h2>
    <br>

    <p>This data set that I had chosen has a list of cricket players who scored most 
      number of runs in IPL 2022. This data set has many stats of a player like 
      number of matches he played, total number of runs he scored this year(2022), 
      his highest score, his average from all the matches he played, his strike rate, 
      number of 4’s,6’s and number of 50’s and 100’s he scored in that season. Though 
      it has many stats about the players the ranking of players is purely done by the 
      total number of runs they scored in that particular season.</p>
    
      
      <h4>DATASET LINK:</h4>
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16980NOHQ65hMK50s-qMwESjGbF8t_3ix/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=112017744010224574501&rtpof=true&sd=true">DATASET</a>

    <h2>What is the use/purpose of this data set?</h2>
    
    
    <p>1) This data set will be helpful for every single cricket fan out there, because
      they see how many runs their favorite player has scored in that season ,and
      they get to know not only the total number of runs which is shown on television
      sometimes, but they get some detailed information such as how many balls he
      faced by looking at the BF(Balls Faced) column and also how many times they
      have been not out for the entire match using the NO(Not Out) column. Not
      only will they get to know where their favorite player stands among the rest of
      the players, but they also get to compare them with different players based not
      only on runs but a lot many other stats.<br> 2) This data set is going to be very
      helpful for the managers of the team that are looking to buy a good batter for
      next season in the upcoming auction. From this data set they will be able to
      analyse which player would fit into their team perfectly. For example if a team
      requires an experienced captain ,then they can simply look into the Mat column
      and they can pick a players who is not only is experienced enough, but also full
      fills their other requirements along with it.

<h2>Various stats about the players in the data set</h2>
<p>These days a lot of statistics about each and every single batsmen are being 
  calculated. Some of these most important statistcs that basically define the 
  player are included in this data set.
  <br>  Mat:
  This column gives information on total number of matches a particular individ- 
  ual has played in that particular season. Since a team has to play atleast 14 
  matches , a players who has played 14 or above can be considered a good player 
  since their team didn’t dropped him for a single match.
  <br>  NO:
  This column gives information on how many times a player has not been out in 
  an entire innings though he entered the crease.
  <br>  Runs:
  This column shows the total number of runs scored by a particular individual.
  <br>  HS:
  This column gives the highest score that a particular individual has scored in 
  that season.
  <br>  Avg:
  This column gives the average runs scored by a payer in that season.
  <br>  BR:
  This column gives the total number of balls a particular player has faced in that 
  season.
  <br>  SR:
  This column gives strike rate of a player in that season. This is calculated using 
  the other two columns, Runs and BF.
  Strike Rate = (Runs/BF(Balls Faced)) x 100
  <br>  100
  : This column gives the number of centuries scored by a player. This information 
  shows that a player has the capabilities to win a match for his team as a one 
  man army, because scoring 100 in t20 is really tough , this information shows 
  that he can take the responsibility to carry the team for victory.
  <br>  50:
  This column gives the number of half-centuries scored by a player.
  <br>  4’s:
  This column gives the number of 4’s scored by a player.
  <br>  6’s:
  This column gives the number of 6’s scored by a player. This information can 
  be used to identify an explosive and aggressive batsman who has the power to 
  hit maximums when they are most needed for the team.</p>

    <h3>Visualization Using Gephi</h3>
    <h4>ABOUT GEPHI:</h4>
    <p>Gephi is an open-source and free software application used for visualizing and exploring complex networks and graphs. It was first released in 2008 and is now widely used in various fields, including social sciences, biology, and computer science. Gephi provides a user-friendly and interactive interface that allows users to import, manipulate, and visualize data in the form of nodes and edges. Nodes represent the entities in the network, while edges represent the connections or relationships between them. The data can be imported from various sources such as CSV files, spreadsheets, and databases.</p>

<h4>MY EXPERIENCE WITH GEPHI:</h4>
<p>Gephi was something that was not so hard,but it wasn't easy either. First I had no idea about gephi and just started to run it by simply importing my dataset and I did got some pretty weird visuvalization. Then I got to know that basically  it works on the concept of graphs that include nodes and edges. And one more thing I got to know was that we should be sending our dataset in two columns, source and target. Then I got a graph visuvalization that included both nodes and edges.The above graph shows graph of country and their AQI Category.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>  

  <p>This data set is more useful for the managers for the teams who are planning
    for the next IPL auction and for the cricket fans who want to see where their
    favorite player stands among the rest of the players. This data set is used to
    know the winner of orange cap, which is awarded for the player who scorers the
    most number of runs by the end of the season, since this data set ranking is
    based on Runs column. This data set also gives information on each players play
    style. For example players with best strike rate are considered to be aggressive
    and players with best average are considered as consistent players.</p>
